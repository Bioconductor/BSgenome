\title{The BSgenome class}

\description{
  A container for the complete genome sequence of a given specie.
}

\details{
    [TODO: Put some details here]
}

\section{Accesor methods}{
  In the code snippets below,
  \code{x} is a BSgenome object.

  \describe{
    \item{}{
      \code{seqnames(x)}:
      Returns the index of the single sequences contained in \code{x}.
      Each single sequence is stored in a \link[Biostrings]{BString} (or derived)
      object and comes from a source file (FASTA) with a single record.
      The names returned by \code{seqnames(x)} usually reflect the names
      of those source files but a common prefix or suffix was eventually
      removed in order to keep them as short as possible.
    }
    \item{}{
      \code{mseqnames(x)}:
      Returns the index of the multiple sequences contained in \code{x}.
      Each multiple sequence is stored in a \link[Biostrings]{BStringViews}
      object and comes from a source file (FASTA) with multiple records.
      The names returned by \code{mseqnames(x)} usually reflect the names
      of those source files but a common prefix or suffix was eventually
      removed in order to keep them as short as possible.
    }
    \item{}{
      \code{names(x)}:
      Returns the index of all sequences contained in \code{x}.
      This is the same as \code{c(seqnames(x), mseqnames(x))}.
    }
  }
}

\section{Standard generic methods}{
  In the code snippets below,
  \code{x} is a BSgenome object
  and \code{name} is the name of a sequence (character-string).

  \describe{
    \item{}{
      \code{length(x)}:
      Returns the length of \code{x}, i.e., the number of all sequences
      that it contains. This is the same as \code{length(names(x))}.
    }
    \item{}{
      \code{x[[name]]}:
      [TODO: Document me]
    }
    \item{}{
      \code{x$name}:
      [TODO: Document me]
    }
  }
}

\section{Other functions and generics}{
  In the code snippets below,
  \code{x} is a BSgenome object
  and \code{name} is the name of a sequence (character-string).

    \item{}{
      \code{unload(x, name)}:
