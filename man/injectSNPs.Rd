\title{SNP injection}

\description{
   Inject SNPs from a SNPlocs data package into a genome.
}

\usage{
  available.SNPs(type=getOption("pkgType"))
  injectSNPs(x, SNPlocs_pkgname)

  ## Related utilities
  SNPlocs_pkgname(x)
  SNPcount(x)
  SNPlocs(x, seqname)
}

\arguments{
  \item{type}{
    Character string indicating the type of package (\code{"source"},
    \code{"mac.binary"} or \code{"win.binary"}) to look for.
  }
  \item{x}{
    A \link[BSgenome:BSgenome-class]{BSgenome} object.
  }
  \item{SNPlocs_pkgname}{
    The name of a SNPlocs data package containing SNP information for the
    single sequences contained in \code{x}.
    This package must be already installed (\code{injectSNPs} won't try to
    install it).
  }
  \item{seqname}{
    The name of a single sequence in \code{x}.
  }
}

\value{
  \code{available.SNPs} returns a character vector containing the names of the
  SNPlocs data packages that are currently available on the Bioconductor
  repositories for your version of R/Bioconductor. A SNPlocs data package
  contains basic SNP information (location and alleles) for a given organism.

  \code{injectSNPs} returns a copy of the original genome \code{x} where some
  or all of the single sequences were altered by injecting the SNPs defined in
  the \code{SNPlocs_pkgname} package.

  \code{SNPlocs_pkgname}, \code{SNPcount} and \code{SNPlocs} return \code{NULL}
  if no SNPs were injected in \code{x} (i.e. if \code{x} is not a
  \link[BSgenome:BSgenome-class]{BSgenome} object returned by a previous
  call to \code{injectSNPs}). Otherwise \code{SNPlocs_pkgname} returns
  the name of the package from  which the 
  SNPs were injected, \code{SNPcount} the number of SNPs for each altered
  sequence in \code{x}, and \code{SNPlocs} their locations in the sequence
  whose name is specified by \code{seqname}.
}

\note{
  \code{injectSNPs}, \code{SNPlocs_pkgname}, \code{SNPcount} and \code{SNPlocs}
  have the side effect to try to load the SNPlocs data package if it's not
  already loaded.
