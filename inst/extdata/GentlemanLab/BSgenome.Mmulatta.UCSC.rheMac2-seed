	## Upstream sequences
	## ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	## Starting with BioC 3.0, the upstream1000, upstream2000, and
	## upstream5000 sequences for rheMac2 are not included in the BSgenome
	## data package anymore. However they can easily be extracted from the
	## full genome sequences with something like:
	.
	library(GenomicFeatures)
	txdb <- makeTxDbFromUCSC("rheMac2", "refGene")
	gn <- sort(genes(txdb))
	up1000 <- flank(gn, width=1000)
	up1000seqs <- getSeq(genome, up1000)
	.
	## IMPORTANT: Make sure you use a TxDb package (or TxDb object),
	## that contains a gene model based on the exact same reference genome
	## as the BSgenome object you pass to getSeq(). Note that you can make
	## your own custom TxDb object from various annotation resources.
	## See the makeTxDbFromUCSC(), makeTxDbFromBiomart(),
	## and makeTxDbFromGFF() functions in the GenomicFeatures
	## package.
