Package: BSgenome.Mmulatta.UCSC.rheMac2
Title: Full genome sequences for Macaca mulatta (UCSC version rheMac2)
Description: Full genome sequences for Macaca mulatta (Rhesus) as provided by UCSC (rheMac2, Jan. 2006) and stored in Biostrings objects.  NOTE: In most assemblies available at UCSC, Tandem Repeats Finder repeats were filtered to retain only the repeats with period <= 12.  However, the filtering was omitted for this assembly, so the TRF masks contain all Tandem Repeats Finder results.
