	## Upstream sequences
	## ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	## Starting with BioC 3.0, the upstream1000, upstream2000, and
	## upstream5000 sequences for mm9 are not included in the BSgenome data
	## package anymore. However they can easily be extracted from the full
	## genome sequences with something like:
	.
	library(TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm9.knownGene)
	txdb <- TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm9.knownGene
	gn <- sort(genes(txdb))
	up1000 <- flank(gn, width=1000)
	up1000seqs <- getSeq(genome, up1000)
	.
	## IMPORTANT: Make sure you use a TxDb package (or TranscriptDb object),
	## that contains a gene model based on the exact same reference genome
	## as the BSgenome object you pass to getSeq(). Note that you can make
	## your own custom TranscriptDb object from various annotation resources.
	## See the makeTranscriptDbFromUCSC(), makeTranscriptDbFromBiomart(),
	## and makeTranscriptDbFromGFF() functions in the GenomicFeatures
	## package.
