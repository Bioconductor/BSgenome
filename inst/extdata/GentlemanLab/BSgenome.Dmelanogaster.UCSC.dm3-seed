	## Upstream sequences
	## ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	## Starting with BioC 3.0, the upstream1000, upstream2000, and
	## upstream5000 sequences for dm3 are not included in the BSgenome data
	## package anymore. However they can easily be extracted from the full
	## genome sequences with something like:
	.
	library(TxDb.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm3.ensGene)
	txdb <- TxDb.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm3.ensGene
	.
	## Because the chrU and chrUextra sequences are made of concatenated
	## scaffolds (see http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=dm3),
	## extracting the upstream sequences for genes located on these
	## scaffolds is not reliable. So we exclude them:
	exclude <- c("chrU", "chrUextra")
	up1000seqs <- extractUpstreamSeqs(genome, txdb, width=1000,
	                                  exclude.seqlevels=exclude)
	.
	## IMPORTANT: Make sure you use a TxDb package (or TxDb object),
	## that contains a gene model based on the exact same reference genome
	## as the BSgenome object you pass to getSeq(). Note that you can make
	## your own custom TxDb object from various annotation resources.
	## See the makeTxDbFromUCSC(), makeTxDbFromBiomart(),
	## and makeTxDbFromGFF() functions in the GenomicFeatures
	## package for more information.
